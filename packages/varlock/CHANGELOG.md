# varlock

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- [#483](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/483) [`ba61adb`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/ba61adb19bd5516f0b48827b386fd7170afe66b5) - Add support for single-file ESM and TypeScript plugins, and improve the plugin authoring API.

  **New: ESM and TypeScript single-file plugins**

  Single-file plugins can now be written as `.mjs` or `.ts` files in addition to `.js`/`.cjs`. TypeScript plugins require Bun.

  **Improved: explicit `plugin` import instead of injected global**

  Plugin authors should now import `plugin` explicitly from `varlock/plugin-lib` rather than relying on the injected global:

  ```js
  // CJS plugin (.js / .cjs)
  const { plugin } = require("varlock/plugin-lib");

  // ESM plugin (.mjs / .ts)
  import { plugin } from "varlock/plugin-lib";
  ```

  This works in both regular installs and SEA binary builds. Error classes (`ValidationError`, `CoercionError`, etc.) are also now directly importable from `varlock/plugin-lib`.

  **Breaking change:** the implicit `plugin` global is no longer injected into CJS plugin modules. Existing plugins must add `const { plugin } = require('varlock/plugin-lib')`.

### Patch Changes

- [#503](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/503) [`6fe325d`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/6fe325da965c956d1c01c78535c5a5e65524d7a8) - Fix Docker image failing to run due to missing `libstdc++` and `libgcc_s` shared libraries on Alpine Linux. The bun-compiled binary dynamically links against these C++ runtime libraries, which are now installed in the Docker image via `apk add libstdc++`.

- [#507](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/507) [`76c17f8`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/76c17f8506fb0bd53b5b8d1a87dae25ab517a1ee) - Fix @import(enabled=...) and @disable conditions not seeing values from .env, .env.local, and env-specific files

  Previously, import conditions and imported file @disable decorators were evaluated during .env.schema's initialization, before other files (.env, .env.local, .env.ENV, .env.ENV.local) were loaded. This meant that variables set in those files were not available when resolving conditions like `enabled=eq($AUTH_MODE, "azure")` or `@disable=not(eq($AUTH_MODE, "azure"))`.

  Now, DirectoryDataSource loads all auto-loaded files first (registering their config items), then processes imports in a separate pass. This ensures all file values are available when import/disable conditions are evaluated.

## 0.6.4

### Patch Changes

- [#490](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/490) [`2959826`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/2959826c6c89c732a9318cfe037dd928813c50b7) - Fix process crash when config folder is not writable (e.g., in Kubernetes containers). The anonymous ID write failure now logs at debug level and continues gracefully instead of calling `gracefulExit(1)`.

- [#472](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/472) [`0ca309d`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/0ca309dea1ecabfc456d01679064f2862dd75809) - Fix: `varlock load --format shell` now properly escapes special characters in values.

  Values are now wrapped in single quotes instead of double quotes, preventing shell injection via backticks, `$()` subshell syntax, and variable expansion (`$VAR`). Single quotes within values are safely escaped using the `'\''` sequence.

- [#475](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/475) [`583c2f8`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/583c2f8405db8c60915767990d12f9469e34ffcb) Thanks [@developerzeke](https://github.com/developerzeke)! - Add ts-nocheck directive to ts type-generation output

- [#481](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/481) [`80c0475`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/80c04751e5cd58bb185ddac50386490ea20479cd) - Fix: invalid load path errors now throw a `CliExitError` instead of logging and calling `gracefulExit`, for consistent error handling across the CLI.

## 0.6.3

### Patch Changes

- [#453](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/453) [`bb1c075`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/bb1c0755dc826a7322ecbbfa26c01c1b99f2bcb1) - Add support for configuring the default env file load path via `package.json`.

  You can now set a `varlock.loadPath` key in your `package.json` to configure the default path used when loading `.env` files:

  ```json title="package.json"
  {
    "varlock": {
      "loadPath": "./envs/"
    }
  }
  ```

  This is useful when you store your `.env` files in a custom directory (e.g., when using Vite's `envDir` option). The CLI `--path` flag continues to override this setting when provided.

  The Vite integration will also now show a warning if `envDir` is set in your Vite config, with instructions to use `varlock.loadPath` in `package.json` instead.

## 0.6.2

### Patch Changes

- [#450](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/450) [`40b65e8`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/40b65e82578d358917b916c9bc1436849d0400a8) - fix: warning-level schema errors no longer block plugin loading or item resolution

  Warning errors (e.g., deprecated syntax warnings) were incorrectly treated as hard errors in several places, causing early bail-outs that prevented plugins from loading and items from resolving. Fixed `isValid`, `finishLoad`, and decorator `resolve` checks to filter out warnings.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#445](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/445) [`57f0e04`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/57f0e04e1f86b22f08a3a3a0a1bce29b7f38d1fc) - update bun to v1.3.11 - publish new binaries

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#436](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/436) [`eaf6c10`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/eaf6c104259899df6fa4128cfe569f7ef3e9acac) - fix: switch plugins to CJS output to fix plugin loading errors in the standalone binary

  Previously plugins were built as ESM and the loader performed a fragile regex-based ESM→CJS transformation. Plugins now build as CJS directly and are loaded via `new Function` in the main runtime context, which avoids both the ESM parse errors and Node.js internal assertion failures (e.g. `DOMException` lazy getter crashing in vm sandbox contexts).

- [#438](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/438) [`b540985`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/b5409857a74874bbcd8850251a38e51ddcb8e6a4) - general cleanup and standardization of plugins

  feat: add `standardVars` plugin property for automatic env var detection warnings

  Plugins can now declaratively set `plugin.standardVars` to define well-known env vars they use. The loading infrastructure automatically checks for these vars in the environment and shows non-blocking warnings (in pretty output or on failure) when they are detected but not wired into the schema or plugin decorator. Green highlighting indicates items that need to be added.

### Patch Changes

- [#421](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/421) [`7b31afe`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/7b31afecf9b571452be87c86f9ef54731235c06e) - feat: add `ifs()` function and update `remap()` to support positional arg pairs

  - **New `ifs()` function**: Excel-style conditional that evaluates condition/value pairs and returns the value for the first truthy condition. An optional trailing default value is used when no condition matches.

    ```env-spec
    API_URL=ifs(
      eq($ENV, production), https://api.example.com,
      eq($ENV, staging), https://staging-api.example.com,
      http://localhost:3000
    )
    ```

  - **Updated `remap()` function**: Now supports positional `(match, result)` pairs as the preferred syntax. The old key=value syntax (`result=match`) is still supported but deprecated.

    ```env-spec
    # new preferred syntax (match first, result second)
    APP_ENV=remap($CI_BRANCH, "main", production, regex(.*), preview, undefined, development)

    # old syntax (still works but deprecated)
    APP_ENV=remap($CI_BRANCH, production="main", preview=regex(.*), development=undefined)
    ```

- [#429](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/429) [`dbf0bd4`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/dbf0bd4fb46918cafb7b72cb0cfd4bbc9132b3d3) - fix: defer plugin auth errors until resolver is actually used, and prefix resolution errors with resolver function name for clearer error messages

- [#393](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/393) [`1e8bca6`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/1e8bca69b0f455ed58390545a1f9cbfb90d92131) - turbopack support

- [#431](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/431) [`ab417d7`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/ab417d772ed06d671060a16273f33c1503e44333) - Fix: Exclude `.env.local` files and their imports from generated TypeScript types.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- [#406](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/406) [`ca51993`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/ca5199371cd6126794e215f67cfcc5f20342eaaa) - Relax header divider requirement - the header block no longer requires a trailing `# ---` divider. All comment blocks before the first config item are now treated as part of the header. Add validation errors for misplaced decorators: item decorators in the header, root decorators on config items, and decorators in detached comment blocks.

### Patch Changes

- [#398](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/398) [`4d436ff`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/4d436ff42863136fb5ebb7016e525ef54732ea20) - fix: convert plugin file paths to `file://` URLs before dynamic `import()` to resolve `ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ESM_URL_SCHEME` on Windows

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- [#385](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/385) [`5890ee6`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/5890ee6864930ac4561589d86c87e749733e3755) - fix: `patchGlobalResponse` broke `fetch()` responses failing `instanceof Response` checks. After patching `globalThis.Response` with `VarlockPatchedResponse`, native `fetch()` still returned the original `Response` instances, causing SvelteKit SSR endpoints to throw "handler should return a Response object". Added `Symbol.hasInstance` to `VarlockPatchedResponse` so native responses pass the check.

- [#384](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/384) [`0642185`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/06421851813e838ea38a4730ab5dec55d8b625ed) - Fix telemetry disable command showing incorrect success message

- [#387](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/387) [`64c8ba9`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/64c8ba98be7f5616ac556b8e4bd6a66bd73767d4) - fix: auto trigger type generation in `varlock run` (unless auto=false flag is used)

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- [#358](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/358) [`c7e2d7a`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/c7e2d7a752e53a1bbb30fddf4fb88e7834d47be3) - Add `shell` output format to `varlock load` command. `--format shell` outputs `export KEY=VALUE` lines suitable for `eval` or sourcing into the current shell session, enabling easy integration with tools like [direnv](https://direnv.net/).

- [#371](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/371) [`1b9797e`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/1b9797ed339b6b9955d5356da4f29517d23dfea3) - Fix dynamic `@required` being incorrectly resolved after type generation runs.

  When `generateTypesIfNeeded()` ran before `resolveEnvValues()` (as it does in the CLI), `getTypeGenInfo()` would call `resolve()` on dynamic decorators like `@required=eq($OTHER, foo)` before their dependencies were resolved. This cached a stale result on the decorator, causing `processRequired()` to return the wrong value when env values were later resolved.

  The fix skips calling `resolve()` for dynamic decorators in `getTypeGenInfo()` — their runtime value is irrelevant for type generation anyway (dynamic required items are always typed as optional).

- [#364](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/364) [`78307f9`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/78307f987dbc25a3c0565b6739802e9f06a8305a) - fix: `varlock printenv MY_VAR` was failing with `Variable "printenv" not found in schema` because gunshi includes the subcommand name in `ctx.positionals`. Now correctly slices past the subcommand path to extract the variable name.

- [#356](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/356) [`61e2094`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/61e2094f28ab9d6abcc9aefebfdd267a88dea2b2) - Add `enabled` option to `@setValuesBulk` decorator, allowing conditional bulk value injection based on boolean expressions (including dynamic expressions referencing other config items).

- [#352](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/352) [`0e4d39a`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/0e4d39acba3707cfb30f534ed47161e64b805a00) - Support XDG Base Directory Specification for user config directory. Varlock now respects `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and defaults to `~/.config/varlock` instead of `~/.varlock` for new installations, while maintaining backwards compatibility with existing `~/.varlock` directories.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#342](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/342) [`e30ec1f`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/e30ec1f6c193365903c734f9443dea0ae420c9bb) - Environment-independent type generation

  - Type generation now runs before env value resolution, producing deterministic TypeScript types regardless of which environment is active
  - Added `isEnvSpecific` tracking on data sources to identify environment-dependent files (`.env.production`, conditional `@disable`, conditional `@import`)
  - Items defined only in env-specific files are excluded from generated types
  - Added `auto=false` parameter to `@generateTypes` decorator to disable automatic type generation during `varlock load` and `varlock run`
  - Added `varlock typegen` command for manual type generation

### Minor Changes

- [#316](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/316) [`9d8302f`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/9d8302f2397abef7b49a62d1700f1339be8aa8d9) - Add `varlock scan` command to detect leaked secrets in project files, with `--install-hook` flag to set up a git pre-commit hook. Automatically detects package manager (npm, pnpm, bun, etc.) and hook managers (husky, lefthook, simple-git-hooks) for correct setup.

- [#313](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/pull/313) [`ccff56b`](https://github.com/dmno-dev/varlock/commit/ccff56b6fba018c3e30d3f91261a4a03c1548c6d) - migrate to bun as package manager and for SEA

When multiple lockfiles are found (e.g., both package-lock.json and bun.lockb), the detection now:
  1. First tries env var based detection (npm_config_user_agent) to respect the currently active package manager
  2. If that fails, returns the first detected package manager as a fallback
  3. No longer throws an error, preventing CLI crashes in monorepos or when switching package managers
